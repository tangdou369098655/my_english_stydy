        Late Again!  又迟到了
        “putrid cheese puffs!”it was nine o’clock and i,Geronimo Stilton, was late for work - again! I rolled out of bed in a minute and was dressed in two. Pretty fast, considering I am really not a morning mouse.
        “腐烂的奶酪泡芙!“当时是9点钟，我杰罗尼莫·斯蒂尔顿上班又迟到了!我马上从床上爬起来，身上穿了两件衣服。很快，考虑到我真的不是一只早起的老鼠。  
        “cheese slices! I hate Monday mornings,” I grumbled while brushing my teeth with cheddar-flavored toothpaste. Then I hurried downstairs, stumbled over my tail, and tumbled all the way down to the door.
        “奶酪片!我讨厌星期一早上。”我一边用切达味的牙膏刷牙，一边抱怨着。然后我匆忙下楼，被自己的尾巴绊了一跤，一路滚到门口。
        Thump! Thump! Thump! So much for being quiet as a mouse.
        捶击！捶击！捶击！安静得像只老鼠。
        The streets of New Mouse City, the capital of Mouse Island, were as noisy as ever. I guess everyone was late just like me. Cheese delivery trucks were everywhere, horns blasting. Mice, rats, and rodents of every size and shape raced by in cars, taxis, and Mouse Jordan sneakers.
        老鼠岛的首都新鼠城的街道一如既往地喧闹。我想每个人都像我一样迟到了。到处都是送奶酪的卡车，喇叭响个不停。老鼠、大鼠和各种体型的啮齿动物在汽车、出租车和老鼠乔丹球鞋里跑来跑去。
        “Texi!” I shouted, jumping into a cab. ‘Seventeen Swiss Cheese Center,’
        “Texi !我喊道，跳上了一辆出租车。“十七瑞士奶酪中心”
        Minutes later, we pulled up to my editorial office. Oh, yes, I 
        Forgot to tell you that I run a newspaper. It’s called The Rodent’s Gazette. 
        几分钟后，我们把车开到我的编辑部。哦,是的,我
        忘了告诉你我在办报纸。它叫做《啮齿动物报》。
        I took the stairs two at a time and burst inside. What a workout! I was pooped. Maybe I shouldn’t have canceled my membership at Rats La Lanne after all.
        我一步两级地爬上楼梯，冲了进去。什么锻炼!我是精疲力尽。也许我不该取消我在rat La Lanne的会员资格。
        But before I could think about it, Mousella, my secretary ,tackled me.
        但我还没来得及想，我的秘书穆塞拉就把我扑倒了。
        
        
        “ellr. Jtilton,FINALLY!” she cried, her glasses dangling off one ear. ‘There is a crowd of rodents waiting to see you: the designers, the printers, the mouse who works the water cooler ... and the editor in chief wants to speak with you immediately.’
        “艾尔，杰蒂尔顿，你终于来了！”她叫道，她的眼镜垂在一只耳朵上。“有一群啮齿动物在等着见你：设计师、打印机、操作饮水机的老鼠…总编辑想马上和你谈谈。
        I headed to my desk. Mousella followed. 
        ‘The copy machine is jammed,’ she continued. ‘Another mailrooom mouse quit. And, Boss, don’t forget you promised me a raise!’
        ”我走向我的办公桌。Mousella跟着。“复印机卡住了，”她继续说。“又一只收发室的老鼠辞职了。老板，别忘了你答应过给我加薪！”
        My head felt like it was about to explode. Even my whiskers hurt. I wouldn’t wish this day on the meanest  ever! 
        我的头好像要爆炸了，连我的胡须都疼。我不希望这一天是有史以来最槽糕的一天！
