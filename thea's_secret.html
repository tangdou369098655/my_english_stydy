        Thea’s Secret
西娅的秘密
At lunchtime, my sister, Thea, who is a special correspondent for The Rodent’s Gazette, came by on her motorcycle.
午饭时，我姐姐西娅骑着摩托车过来了，她是《啮齿类动物报》的特约记者。
“I am taking you out for lunch.” She said. “We’ve got reservations at The Mouse House.” She grabbed my paw and whispered, ‘I have to tell you a very important secret.’
“我带你出去吃午饭。”她说。“我们在老鼠之家订了房间。”她抓住我的爪子小声说，“我必须告诉你一个非常重要的秘密。”
Twenty minutes later, I peeled myself off Thea’s motorcycle. My teeth were still chattering.
二十分钟后，我从西娅的摩托车上脱掉了皮。我的牙齿还在打颤。
“Are you trying to give me a heart attack?” I shrieked, tugging my whiskers back into shape. “Why, why, why do you have to go so fast? ”It’s dangerous! One day, We’re going to end up sipping cheese through straws at Mouse Generel !!!
“你想让我心脏病发作吗？”我尖叫着，把胡须拉回原形。“为什么，为什么，你为什么要走得这么快？太危险了！总有一天，我们会在老鼠将军那里用吸管啜饮奶酪！！”
‘Tsk, tsk... Still the same old ’ fraidy mouse’ . My sister laughed, slipping into the restaurant.
“啧啧，啧啧。。。仍然是老“脆弱的老鼠”。我妹妹笑了，溜进了餐厅。
Of course, before we could sit down, Thea had to greet fifty friends.
当然，我们还没来得及坐下，西娅就得招呼五十个朋友。
‘Hi, Ratsp! How you doing, Swissita!’
“嗨，瑞斯普！你好，斯威西塔！”
I rolled my eyes, Thea had more friends than a cheese delivery man the day before Thanksgiving!
我翻白眼，西娅的朋友比感恩节前一天送奶酪的人还多！
Finally, we were seated.
最后，我们就座了。
‘So what is it?’ I asked impatiently.
“那是什么？”我不耐烦地问。
But my sister was busy looking at the menu. ‘Why don’t we order first ?’ She said. ‘Cheddar ravioli for two!’ she told the waiter. ‘With extra-spicy tomato sauce.’
但我妹妹正忙着看菜单。“我们为什么不先点呢？”她说。“两个人的切达馄饨！”她告诉侍者。“加上特别辣的番茄酱。”
“Spicy ?” I groaned. ‘You know I get heartburn.’ Did I mention my sister can be incredibly annoying at times?
“辣吗？”我呻吟着。“你知道我心痛。”我有没有提到我妹妹有时会非常烦人？
Thea waved her paw. ‘Oh, please. You could use a little spice in your life. Besides, you’ll have to get used to eating all sorts of food on our trip,’ she whispered, winking at me.
西娅挥了挥手。“哦，求你了。你可以在你的生活中使用一些调味品。此外，你还得习惯在我们的旅途中吃各种各样的食物，”她低声说，对我眨眼。
‘Trip ? What trip?’ I asked.
“旅行？什么旅行？”我问。
‘Ssssssssh! Shhh. Do you want everybody to know?’ She said, pinching my tail.
“嘘嘘！嘘。你想让大家都知道吗？”她捏着我的尾巴说。
‘Well, what are you talking about?’ I hissed.
“你在说什么？”我嘶嘶地说。
Thea glanced around. ‘Hold you whiskers. I think the waiter may be spying on us. He looks a little suspicious.’ she said.
西娅环顾四周。“留着胡子。我想服务员可能在监视我们。“他看起来有点可疑。”她说。
‘Who on earth would want to spy on us?’ I cried. My head tarted to pound.
“到底是谁想监视我们？”我哭了。我的头开始砰砰作响。
‘If you only knew...’ my sister replied, looking very mysterious.
“如果你知道的话……”我姐姐回答，看起来很神秘。
I clenched my fists. I couldn’t take it anymore. I climbed onto my chair and screamed. ‘What are you talking about?’
我紧握拳头。我再也受不了了。我爬上椅子尖叫起来。“你在说什么？！”
Every stared.
大家都盯着看。
‘Slimy Swiss balls! Someone got up on the wrong side of the hole today,’
said Thea. But she began talking anyway. ‘I found a map of an island showing the spot where treasure is buried.’ she squeaked. ‘The emerald eye!’
“粘糊糊的瑞士球！“今天有人站错了地方，”西娅说。但她还是开始说话，“我发现了一张显示宝藏埋藏地点的岛屿地图。”她尖叫着说。“翡翠眼！”
From under the table she pulled out a yellowed piece of paper.
她从桌子底下拿出一张发黄的纸。
‘I found this map at the flea market,’ she continued. ‘Oh, Gerrykins, you must come with me. This is a once-in-a-lifetime chance!’ she finished excitedly.
“我在跳蚤市场找到了这张地图，”她接着说。“哦，格里金斯，你必须跟我来。这是千载难逢的机会！”她兴奋地说完。
‘First of all, don’t call me Gerrykins. My name is Geronimo! I cried, Second, I will be too busy at work. We are about to publish the next volume of Rodent Rules For Dummies. And besides, who ever heard of an emerald eye ? It’s ridiculous !’
“首先，别叫我格里金斯。我叫杰罗尼莫！“我哭了，”第二，我工作太忙了。我们即将出版下一卷《啮齿动物假人规则》。再说，谁听说过翡翠眼？真可笑！”
Thea grabbed my paw and stared straight into my eyes. ‘But you’re my big brother you can’t let me go on my own, Gerry berry! ’ she squeaked in her sweetest voice. My sister could convince a cat to cook dinner for her.
西娅抓住我的爪子，直盯着我的眼睛。“但你是我的大哥-你不能让我一个人去，杰瑞·贝瑞！”她用她最甜美的声音尖叫。我妹妹能说服一只猫为她做晚饭。
‘The name is Geronimo !’ I shouted.
“我叫葛罗倪墨！”我喊道。
That night, I drank about ten cups of  snoozytime tea, listened to my squeaky-sounds sleep tape, and counted grilled cheese sandwiches. Still, I didn’t sleep one wink !
那天晚上，我喝了大约十杯催眠茶，听了我吱吱作响的睡眠磁带，数了数烤奶酪三明治。不过，我一眨眼也没睡！
