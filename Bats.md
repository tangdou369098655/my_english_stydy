and we have only to turn to that extraordinary discovery of echo-location in bats to see a case in which the voice plays a strictly utilitarian role.

> Everyone knows that if he shouts in the vicinity of a wall or a mountainside, an echo will come
back.
> 大家都知道，在墙壁或山腰附近发出的喊声，就会听到回声。
> shouts 大喊
> vicinity 附近，近处
> mountainside 山腰
> echo 回声，反射
 
> The further off this solid obstruction, the longer time will elapse for the return of the echo.
 
> 固体障碍物越远，回声返回所用时间就越长。
> solid obstruction 固体障碍物
> elapse 消逝

> A sound made by tapping on the hull of a ship will be reflected from the sea bottom, 
 
> 敲打船体所发了的声音会从海底传回来
> tapping on the hull of a ship 轻敲船身

> and by measuring the time interval between the taps and the receipt of the echoes the depth of the sea
at that point can be calculated.
> 测出回声间隔的时间，便可算出该处海洋的深度。
> interval  间隔
> receipt 收到，收据
> calculated 计算，估算

> With experience, and with improved apparatus, it is now possible not only to locate a shoal but
to tell if it is herring, cod, or other well-known fish, by the pattern of its echo.
> 根据经验和改进了的仪器，不仅能够确定鱼群的位置，而且可以根据鱼群回声的特点分辨出是鲱鱼、鳕鱼，这是人们所熟悉的其他鱼。
> imporoved apparatus 改进了的仪器
> herring 鲱鱼 cod 鳕鱼
> by the pattern of its echo. 通过它回声的方式。

> It has been found that certain bats emit squeaks and by receiving the echoes, they can locate and
steer clear of obstacles -- or locate flying insects on which they feed.
 
> 人们发现，某些蝙蝠能发出尖叫声，并能通过回声来确定并躲开障碍物，或找到它们赖以为
生的昆虫。
