        Cheap junk for less
        The next day, we went to the harbor.
        第二天，我们去了港口。
        ‘So, Gerrykins, promise you’ll come with me. You are not going to let me sail off all on my own !’ insisted Thea.
        “那么，格里金斯，答应我你会和我一起去。你不能让我独自航行！西娅坚持道。
        ‘Don’t call me Gerrykins,’ I cried. ‘The name is Geronimo!’
        “别叫我葛瑞金，”我喊道，“我叫葛罗尼莫！”
        Here’s one thing you should know about my sister. When she gets an idea in her head, it sticks like a mouse in a glue trap.
        关于我妹妹，你应该知道一件事。当她脑子里有了一个想法，它就会像老鼠一样粘在胶水陷阱里。
        Before I knew it, I had promised to go with her on her ridiculous treasure
        Hunting trip. And as every respectable mouse knows, a rodent’s promise is nothing to joke about.
        在我意识到这一点之前，我就答应和她一起去她那可笑的寻宝之旅。每一只可敬的老鼠都知道，啮齿动物的承诺是没有什么可开玩笑的。
        ‘chewy cheese bits!’ shouted Thea, breaking into a dance.
        “咀嚼的奶酪碎片！”西娅喊道，跳起舞来。
        Then Thea showed me a boat belonging to an old retired sea captain. It was the color of cheddar, extra-sharp, my favorite. The ship’s name seemed to be a good sign, too: Lucky Lady.
        然后西娅给我看了一艘属于一位退休的老船长的船。这是切达的颜色，特别锋利，我最喜欢。船的名字似乎也是一个好兆头：幸运女神。
        My sister stared at the ship, then she winked at me. ‘You know, two sailors are really not enough for this boat,’ she said. ‘Do you know who else could come with us? Trap! He says he’s an expert sailor!’
        我姐姐盯着船，然后对我眨眼。“你知道，两个水手真的不够这艘船，”她说。“你知道还有谁能和我们一起去吗？陷阱！他说他是个熟练的水手！”
        My memories of my cousin Trap Stilton, also know as Pushy Paws, were not very good, When he was young, he was a real nightmare.
        我对堂兄Trap Stilton的记忆也不太好，他也被称为急躁的爪子。他年轻时真是个噩梦。
        ‘Trap?!’ I sputtered. ‘But, Thea, don’t you remember when he trid my tail up in a knot ? I had to wear the same pants for a weed! And what about the time he dyed my whiskers with that purple grape juice?’
        “陷阱？！“我咕噜咕噜地说。“可是，西娅，你不记得他把我的尾巴打结了吗？我不得不穿同样的裤子一个星期！那他用紫色葡萄汁染我的胡须呢？”
        But as I said, when my sister gets an idea in her head, there’s no stopping her. Minutes later, we stood in front of Trap’s thrift shop, Cheap Junk for Less. The store window was dusty and full of odd stuff: an old, yellowed photograph, a fake crystal that was supposed to ward off cats, a box of silver whisker-curlers, a super-powered fur dryer.
        但正如我所说，当我妹妹想到一个主意时，她是不会罢休的。几分钟后，我们站在特拉普的旧货商店前，便宜的垃圾换得少。商店的橱窗里满是灰尘，满是奇怪的东西：一张泛黄的旧照片，一块用来挡猫的假水晶，一盒银色的卷须器，一台超级动力的毛皮烘干机。
        We went in. As the door opened, it triggered a bunch of small brass bells hanging from the ceiling. Inside, a plumpish mouse with short paws and a pencil tucked behind his ear sat with his feet up on a comfy reclining chair. He wore baggy blue pants and a pair of bright-red suspenders. It was Trap. He leaped up and scurried toward us with surprising speed.
        我们进去了。当门打开时，它触发了一堆悬挂在天花板上的小铜铃。在里面，一只胖乎乎的老鼠，爪子很短，耳朵后面夹着一支铅笔，两脚向上坐在舒适的躺椅上。他穿着宽松的蓝色裤子和一条鲜红色的吊带。是陷阱。他跳起来，以惊人的速度向我们飞奔而来。
        ‘Well, I’ll be a mouse’s uncle!’ He shouted, crushing my paw in his. ‘Long time no see! Want to buy something? Let me tell you right up front: no discounts. Not even to relatives! Cash only!’ he shouted in our ears.
        “好吧，我要做老鼠叔叔了！”他喊道，把我的爪子压在他的爪子上。“好久不见了！你们俩总是在一起，嗯？像奶油和奶酪。怎么了？想买点东西吗？我先告诉你：不打折。连亲戚都不知道！只收现金！”他在我们耳边喊道。
        ‘Is there somewhere quiet we can talk?’ asked Thea.
        “有什么安静的地方我们可以谈谈吗？西娅问道。
        Trap led us into a library filled with books on every subject. Cats, cheese, cats who eat cheese and the mice who love them. The air smelled musty, as if the windows hadn’t been opened since Chirstopher Columouse discovered Mouse Island.
        陷阱把我们带进了一个图书馆，里面堆满了各种主题的书。猫，奶酪，吃奶酪的猫和爱奶酪的老鼠。空气中弥漫着霉味，仿佛自从克里斯托弗·科伦ouse发现老鼠岛后，窗户就再也没有打开过似的。
        All of a sudden, we heard a horrifying sound. Meeeooowwww!!!!
        突然，我们听到一个可怕的声音。再见！！！
        Thea and I leaped up in the air.
        我和西娅跳到了空中。
        ‘Cat!!!’ we shrieked together.
        “猫！！！”我们一起尖叫。
        Trap rolled around on the floor in a fit of laughter.
        陷阱在地板上滚来滚去，发出一阵笑声。
        ‘Ha! Ha! Ha!’ he sputtered. ‘That’s no cat. It’s just a tape rocording. It comes on automatically as soon as someone enters the library. Pretty cute, don’t you think?’
        “哈！哈！哈！”他喃喃地说。“那不是猫。只是一段录音。一旦有人进入图书馆，它就会自动打开。很可爱，你不觉得吗？”
        ‘Adorable,’ squeaked Thea, rolling her eyes.
        “可爱，”西娅尖叫着，转动着眼睛
        ‘Well , it does keep rat burglars away, and slimy sewer rats, too!’ smirked Trap. ‘Hmmm...I wonder if I could take out a patent on it,’ I could just hear the wheels turning in his tiny mouse-size brain.
        “好吧，它确实能让老鼠入室行窃的人远离，还有黏糊糊的下水道老鼠！“傻笑的陷阱。“嗯。。。我想知道我是否可以申请专利。我能听到他那老鼠大小的小脑袋里的轮子在转动。
        ‘I could make a bundle,’ he mumbled, his eyes shining.Then he turned back to us.
        “我可以做个包裹，”他喃喃地说，眼睛闪闪发光。然后他转向我们。
        ‘So anyway, what are you two looking for? I don’t have much time to shoot the cheese. I’m a very busy mouse, you know,’ he added with pride, puffing up his fur.
        “不管怎样，你们两个在找什么？我没有太多时间吃奶酪。“你知道，我是一只很忙的老鼠，”他骄傲地补充说，一边吹起他的皮毛。
        Trap listened to Thea’s plans with half-closed eyes. But I could tell he was interested because his tail started to twitch when she mentioned the Emerald Eye.
        特拉普半闭着眼睛听着西娅的计划。但我可以看出他很感兴趣，因为当她提到翡翠眼时，他的尾巴开始抽搐。
        ‘Ok. I’ll join you, ’ he agreed. ‘But anyone who dares to lay a paw on my part of the treasure is a dead rat!’
        “好吧。“我和你一起去，”他同意了。“但是任何敢用爪子抓我那部分财宝的人都是死老鼠！”
        We toasted to a successful trip, and twisting our tails together we squeaked: ‘To our trip! Friends together! Mice forever!’
        我们为一次成功的旅行干杯，扭着尾巴尖叫着：“为我们的旅行干杯！朋友们在一起！永远的老鼠！
